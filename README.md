# Wine Refrigeration Selector

This is a web application for selecting wine refrigeration condensing units and evaporators based on your requirements.  
You can enter your BTUH load, refrigerant, ambient temperature, voltage, and evaporator coil style to get matching results.  
Click on any condensing unit or evaporator in the results to see a summary and a list of required addons.

## Features

- Search for condensing units and evaporators by specification
- View unit and evaporator summaries
- See required addons for each selection
- Data is loaded from CSV files

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/wine-select.git
   cd wine-select
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the app locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Open your browser and go to:**  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## CSV Files

- `condunitswine.csv` — contains condensing unit data
- `wineevaps.csv` — contains evaporator data

Both files are stored in this repository and loaded by the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
